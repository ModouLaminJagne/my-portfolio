## Personal Portfolio

As a developer or someone in the tech fraternity, it is necessary and fitting to have a portfolio website that shows your work in the most efficient way.
Evne though it cannot show everything about us, it plays an important roll in dhowing who we are.
This is my portfolio website, built with REACT.js, NEXT.js and styled components.

This webste contains my info but anyone can customize it to fit their profile.
